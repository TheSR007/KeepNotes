</head><body><span style="font-size: 20pt">What is Python?</span><br/>
<span style="font-size: 16pt"><span style="font-family: Arial">Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span><span style="font-size: 20pt">It is used for:</span><br/>
<ul><span style="font-size: 18pt"><li>web development (server-side),</li>
<li>software development,</li>
<li>mathematics,</li>
</span></ul>
<ul><span style="font-size: 18pt">system scripting.</span></ul>

</span><span style="font-size: 20pt">What can Python do?</span>&nbsp; <br/>
<ul><span style="font-size: 18pt"><li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
<li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
<li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
<li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
</span></ul>
<span style="font-size: 18pt"><ul>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</ul>
<br/>
</span><span style="font-size: 20pt"><br/>
</span><span style="font-size: 20pt">Why Python? </span>&nbsp;<br/>
<ul><span style="font-size: 18pt"><li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
<li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
<li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
<li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
</span></ul>
<span style="font-size: 18pt"><ul>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</ul>
<br/>
</span><span style="font-size: 20pt"><br/>
Good to know &nbsp;<br/>
</span><ul><span style="font-size: 18pt"><li>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.</li>
<li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.</li>
</span><li><span style="font-size: 18pt">Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</span></li>
</ul>
